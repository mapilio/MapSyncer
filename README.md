# MapSyncer

This repository provides a streamlined process for downloading user images from Kartaview and uploading them to Mapilio.<br>

Please, follow the steps below to get started:


## Workflow
1. Authenticate for OpenStreetMap.
2. Authenticate for Mapilio.
3. Get the list of sequences uploaded by the user.
4. Download all images and metadata for each sequence.
5. You can select specific sequences or all downloaded sequences that you want to upload to Mapilio.
6. And the process ends successfully.

Don't worry, the RunMapSyncer command will check and do all these operations. üí´
