# MapSyncer

This repository provides a streamlined process for downloading user images from Kartaview and uploading them to Mapilio.<br>

Please, follow the steps below to get started:


## Workflow
The download command follows these steps below:

1. Authenticate the user with OpenStreetMap (OSM) account via Kartaview.
2. Get the list of sequences uploaded by the user.
3. Download all images and metadata for each sequence.
4. Authenticate for Mapilio.
5. You can select the specific sequences you want to upload to Mapilio or all downloaded sequences.
6. And the process ends successfully.

Don't worry, run.py will lead all this for you üí´.
