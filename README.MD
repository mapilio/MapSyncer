# MapSyncer

This repository provides a streamlined process for downloading user images from Kartaview and uploading them to Mapilio.<br>
Follow the steps below to get started:

## Getting Started

1- Clone the **MapSyncer** repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/mapilio/MapSyncer.git
cd MapSyncer
```

## Prerequisites

Before using OSC Tools, ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Additionally, make sure to install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2- Run the **Karta Images Download** script with the desired command. For example:
```
python run.py
```

## Workflow
The download command follows these steps:

1. Authenticate the user with OpenStreetMap (OSM) account via Kartaview.
2. Get the list of sequences uploaded by the user.
3. Create a mapilio_images directory for the user and create a subdirectory for each sequence in it.
4. Download all images for each sequence.
5. Download metadata for each sequence.
6. Authenticate for Mapilio.
7. You can select the specific sequences you want to upload to Mapilio or all downloaded sequences.
8. And the process ends successfully.

## Additional Notes

* The get_exif.py file downloads the exif file according to the sequence id after the download of the images for each sequence is complete and makes it available for Mapilio.
* The download.py module focuses on downloading user images and managing metadata.
* The project utilizes the OSC API for interacting with OpenStreetMap data.
