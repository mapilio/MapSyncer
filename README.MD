Follow the steps below to get started:

## Install dependencies

3. Install the required dependencies:

## Workflow
The download command follows these steps:

1. Authenticate the user with OpenStreetMap (OSM) account via Kartaview.
2. Get the list of sequences uploaded by the user.
3. Download all images and metadata for each sequence.
4. Authenticate for Mapilio.
5. You can select the specific sequences you want to upload to Mapilio or all downloaded sequences.
6. And the process ends successfully.

Don't worry, run.py will lead all this for you üí´. 

## Usage

The whole process will take place in one line 

```
python run.py
```
